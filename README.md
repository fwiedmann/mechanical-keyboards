# mechanical-keyboards

A curated list of my mechanical keyboards + resources for custom builds.

Over the past few years I got addicted to meachnical keyboards and got stuck in the rabbit hole.
Once you're stuck there is no way back. Even more when you built your first lubed keyboard.

Before you buy your first mechanical keyboard, you should consider the following aspcets in order to make the right choice.

- Switches
- Keycap Profiles
- Case
- Lube?
- Layout
