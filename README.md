A curated list of my mechanical keyboards + resources for custom builds.

Over the past few years I got addicted to meachnical keyboards and got stuck in the rabbit hole.
Once you're stuck there is no way back. Even more when you built your first lubed keyboard.

## Considerations

Before you buy your first mechanical keyboard, you should consider the following aspcets in order to make the right choice.

### Switches

There are three different kinds of swwitches which differ by the key action, the typing feeling and the sound.

- Linear: From the start pressing to fully pressed, it feels allways the same. There is no feedback like a bump or a clicky sound.
- Tactile: Provides activation feedback by hitting a bump.
- Clicky: Addition to the tactile bumb it also provides a clicl sound.

Checkout a [sound comparison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm-WuK_9OBM) between those three kind of switches.

There are also two important properties which influence the typing exprerience:

- Activation force: How much force do you need to press the key. Is it more light or hard?
- Key travel: When does the key triggers its activation and how much is the overall travel?

In order to make the right choice you should try each kind of the switch to get a typing feeling.
I do not recommend to buy switches just by their sound.

Below you can checkout a summary chart for different kinds of switches.

### Hot Swap

The most fully assembeled keyboards do not support the capability of swapping the switches.
If you are not sure that the provided switches are the right, go with a keyboard that supports hot-swap.
Instead of buying a new keyboard, just buy new switches and save some $$$.
