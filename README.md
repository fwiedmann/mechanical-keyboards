# mechanical-keyboards ‚å®Ô∏è

A curated list of my mechanical keyboards + resources for custom builds.

Over the past few years I got addicted to mechanical keyboards and got stuck in the rabbit hole.
Once you're stuck there is no way back. Even more when you built your first lubed keyboard.

## Considerations

Before you buy your first mechanical keyboard, you should consider the following aspects in order to make the right choice.

### Switches

There are three different kinds of switches which differ by the key action, the typing feeling and the sound.

- Linear: From the start pressing to fully pressed, it feels always the same. There is no feedback like a bump or a clicky sound.
- Tactile: Provides activation feedback by hitting a bump.
- Clicky: Addition to the tactile bumb it also provides a click sound.

Checkout a [sound comparison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm-WuK_9OBM) between those three kind of switches.

There are also two important properties which influence the typing experience:

- Activation force: How much force do you need to press the key. Is it more light or hard?
- Key travel: When does the key trigger its activation and how long is the overall travel?

In order to make the right choice you should try each kind of the switch to get a typing feeling.
I do not recommend to buy switches just by their sound.

Below you can checkout a summary chart for different kinds of switches.

### Hot Swap

The most fully assembled keyboards do not support the capability of swapping the switches.
If you are not sure that the provided switches are the right, go with a keyboard that supports hot-swap.
Instead of buying a new keyboard, just buy new switches and save some $$$.

### Keycap Profile's

Keycap profiles differ in their height and form:

### Layout

The most mechanical keyboards comes with the default ANSI-Layout (QWERTY). Most of the time there are less keycap layouts for your native language.
Like the German ISO-Layout (QWERTZ). Before you buy a keyboard make sure you selected the correct layout.

I personally switched completly to the ANSI-Layout because IMO it's more convenient for coding.
Due to I still chat/communicate with my colleagues in German, I heavily rely on the German umlauts.

The [EurKey](https://eurkey.steffen.bruentjen.eu/layout.html) project aims to provide the functionality of umlauts for ANSI-Layouts.

## Assembled Builds

All the keyboards which I bought fully assembled.
